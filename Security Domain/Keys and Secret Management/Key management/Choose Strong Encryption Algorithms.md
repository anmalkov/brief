The topic of which encryption algorithm to use all boils down a simple question. How much time can you sacrifice for security? We all know the boot process can take a long time and certain encryption algorithms can almost double that time. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) creates standards for encryption and hand selects the cream of the crop regarding the strongest encryption used in the world, by reading their encryption standards it will be easy for you and your team to select a safe encryption algorithm that works best for your solution.

### Best Practices

- We recommend adopting Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) which is a very secure algorithm with complex mathematics to ensure the strongest encryption of today.
- Asses the data that needs to be encrypted by identifying the critical program information, when you have all the data in front of you, it can be easily determined to use certain algorithms depending on the criticality.
- Ensure you are using one of the approved cryptographic algorithms: hash functions, symmetric key algorithms, and asymmetric key algorithms.
- Assess the encryption tools provided to you from the vendor and determine if they are strong enough, otherwise create tools to utilize outside crypto engines.
- Never roll your own crypto.
