**Principle:** Integrity  
**Affected Asset:** All data stores  
**Threat:** Malicious files can compromise cloud applications and will continue to be an issue if they persist on file storage and databases.

**Mitigation:**

Scan all files before uploading them to non-compute Azure resources.

Use a scanning solution that meets the following criteria:

1. Scans should cover ALL files.
2. Access to unscanned files should be locked down until proof of a fileâ€™s safety is generated.
3. Generate persistent evidence for compliance and security operations purposes.
